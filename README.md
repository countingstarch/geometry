# object-and-door
...in which my program calculates whether something can fit into a door or not, with an interface (HTML). WIP.

Created 2023-01-26 after a trip to the furniture store. Won't work with non-rectangular cuboids. (Maybe in another fork...)

## Features so far
* Calculate the length of the door's diagonal
* Calculate the angle of said diagonal (rad and deg available)
* Calculate the object's faces and their diagonals
* Calculate the volume and 3D diagonal of said object
* Use any length unit you like (yes, even soap bars)
* Live-updated data
* Light and dark themes
* A barely readable README

## Features to come (hopefully)
* Make it actually calculate whether the object will fit in the door
* Interactive WebGL canvas to preview
* A decent interface
* Themes?
