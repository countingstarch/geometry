# object-and-door
...in which my program calculates whether something can fit into a door or not, with an interface (HTML).
Created 2023-01-26 after a trip to the furniture store.

## Features so far
* Calculate the length of the door's diagonal
* Calculate the angle of said diagonal (rad and deg available)
* Use any length unit you like (yes, even soap bars)
* Live-updated data
* Light and dark themes

## Features to come (hopefully)
* Calculate stuff with the object
* Interactive WebGL canvas to preview
* A decent interface
* Themes?
